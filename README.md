* integration with file browser, daemon/installer
* improved scheduling, big files (split between multiple accounts)
* precreated dropbox accounts (instantly assign more data)
* upload from web client, queue upload from download link
* more efficient cluster, scalability (serving large files)
* migrating your dropbox account
